# Your New York Times Birthday

### See the front page from the day you were born

This is a simple React/Redux app ([originally written with just jQuery](https://github.com/TCHayes/NYT-bday)) for viewing headlines and briefs from the New York Times front page on the day you were born (or any other date you enter).

Inspired by the offical [New York Times' Birthday Books](https://www.nytimes.com/store/the-ultimate-birthday-book-the-times-of-your-life-nsap2176.html). Also, if you're an NYT subscriber, I strongly recommend checking out their [TimesMachine](https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/browser/), which lets you browse their archives to view any past paper just as it originally appeared in print.
