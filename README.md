# NYT articles from the day you were born

A simple React/Redux app for viewing headlines and briefs from the New York Times front page on the day you were born (or any other day).

Inspired by the offical [New York Times' Birthday Books](https://www.nytimes.com/store/the-ultimate-birthday-book-the-times-of-your-life-nsap2176.html). Also, if you're an NYT subscriber, I strongly recommend checking out their [TimesMachine](https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/browser/), which lets you browse their archives to view any past paper just as it originally appeared in print.
